Kurt Vonnegut was a 20th century American author, best known for [_Slaugterhouse-Five_](https://www.amazon.com/Slaughterhouse-Five-Novel-Modern-Library-Novels/dp/0385333846). Although Vonnegut passed away in 2007, one of his former writing students, [Suzanne McConnell](https://suzannemcconnell.com/), published in 2019 [_Pity the Reader: On Writing with Style_](https://www.amazon.com/Pity-Reader-Writing-Kurt-Vonnegut/dp/1644210215/), a collection of Vonnegut's writing advice.

You will find the ground work for a chapter or two of _Pity the Reader_ in Vonnegut's "How to Write with Style", an installment in the series "Power of the Printed Word", sponsored by the [International Paper Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Paper) and published in the _IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication_ in 1981 ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1109/TPC.1981.6447837), [PDF](https://kmh-lanl.hansonhub.com/pc-24-66-vonnegut.pdf)).

Vonnegut gives eight suggestions to examine and improve your writing style and says doing so is "a mark of respect for your readers, whatever you're writing".

## 1. Find a subject you care about

Truly caring about the subject is the best part of your writing style.

## 2. Do not ramble

Don't go into every little detail.

## 3. Keep it simple

Simple sentences work best.

## 4. Have the guts to cut

Even well written sentences should be cut if they do not contribute to the topic.

## 5. Sound like yourself

Write like yourself, not, as Vonnegut says, like "cultivated Englishmen of a century or more ago".

## 6. Say what you mean to say

Your writing should be understood due to its clarity, not misunderstood due to its complexity.

## 7. Pity the readers

Write something useful that teaches your readers something.

## 8. For really detailed advice

Vonnegut recommends [_The Elements of Style_](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-William-White-Strunk/dp/B000KW42KM) by Strunk and White.
