title: Where is Eastchester?
category: Random Bits

I often mention Eastchester in posts, referring to a conversation with
"a colleague in Eastchester" or showing an example from "a class I teach in 
Eastchester". But where is Eastchester? You won't find it on any map of the
US Pacific Northwest.

Eastchester is the home of fictional Cascadia College in
[Bernard Malamud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Malamud)'s
novel [_A New Life_](https://www.amazon.com/New-Life-Novel-FSG-Classics/dp/0374529493),
which is loosely based on Malamud's time in the 1950s as an
English instructor at Oregon State College, now known as Oregon State
University, in Corvallis.

The main character, Sy Levin, moves from New York to Eastchester to teach
composition at Cascadia.Â After getting into a few sticky situations, Sy
leaves Eastchester after less than a year, embarking on another, more
uncertain, new life.

This is not a book review, I just wanted to explain the Eastchester
reference. But, if you like the professor literature genre, I highly
recommend _A New Life_.

You may have heard of Malamud's other work, including
[_The Natural_](https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Bernard-Malamud/dp/0374502005),
which was made into a
[motion picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Natural_(film))
in 1984 starring Robert Redford and Glenn Close.
