title: Thankful for OpenSees
category: Random Bits

Thanksgiving is this week, which means campuses across the US will be pretty
quiet.  Monday through Wednesday should be a boon for faculty seeking
"big blocks of time" to write.  Let's hope they feel inspired.

Come Thursday, we'll reflect on what we're thankful for. Family, friends,
and health are perennial list toppers for me.

In addition to gratitude, faculty members should acknowledge how lucky we
are to have a faculty position. For each part good (or great) we think we are
today, ten parts luck got us to this point. If you disagree, check your ego
at the dinner table this Thursday and do some soul searching over the long
weekend.

With respect to OpenSees, I'm thankful that I was in the right place at the
right time in graduate school. Thankful that I had a supportive advisor,
committee members, and Frank helping me out. Thankful that OpenSees caught
on when object-oriented finite element analysis packages were dime-a-dozen.
Thankful that I can use OpenSees to teach structural analysis and to advise
students on research. Thankful that I have colleagues who want to work with me
and make their ideas reality using OpenSees. Thankful that I work with an
incredible post-doc who has taken OpenSees to new levels with FSI and Python.

I get credit for all of that?  I'm very lucky and very thankful.
