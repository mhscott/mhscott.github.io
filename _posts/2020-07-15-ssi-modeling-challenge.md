title: SSI Modeling Challenge
category: Community
---

I know enough soil-structure interaction (SSI) to be dangerous. This 
means I'm no expert in the subject, only someone who is capable of 
describing an SSI modeling challenge.

The subject of this challenge is the soil-bridge model shown below. The 
model is based on research by a former M.S. student and a couple 
colleagues in Eastchester on earthquake-tsunami multi-hazard effects on 
transportation structures. The colleagues are still here, but the 
student went on to do a Ph.D. and post-doc in another US west coast 
college town that also has a Woodstock's Pizza restaurant.

The column/shaft is a 1.1 m diameter reinforced concrete section and the 
soil is a dense sand with relative density _D<sub>r</sub>_=90%. You can 
find more details on the soil-bridge model here, but for this challenge, 
I'd like to keep the model simple. I don't want variance in the results 
to be attributed to approximations of concrete stiffness.

So, let's say the column/shaft is linear-elastic with modulus _E_=25 GPa. 
Also, let's assume free field conditions in formulating the soil 
resistance and a pinned condition at the base of the shaft.

What is the horizontal displacement (units=mm) at the top of the column?

E-mail me your answer by August 31. You don't have to use OpenSees, but 
please let me know how you modeled the soil.

I look forward to your responses. I will share anonymized results in 
another post after the deadline.
