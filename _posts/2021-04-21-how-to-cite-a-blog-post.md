title: How to Cite a Blog Post

How to cite OpenSees was one of the blog's first posts. Several posts have been made since. Most of them non-sense, but there's 
a couple that have enough technical content to be citation-worthy.

Based on its [style guide](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/pdf/10.1061/9780784479018.ch05), ASCE treats blog posts like a website 
where you provide the author, title and publication year of the post, blog name, access date, and URL. Other style guides, 
e.g., APA, require the same information.

For example, if you accessed the 2019 ["How to Cite OpenSees"]({% post_url 2019-09-22-how-to-cite-opensees %}) blog post on 
April 21, 2021, your ASCE-style citation would look like:

> Scott, M. H. (2019) "How to Cite OpenSees." OpenSees Digital (blog). Accessed April 21, 2021. http://openseesdigital.com/2019/09/22/how-to-cite-opensees/.
