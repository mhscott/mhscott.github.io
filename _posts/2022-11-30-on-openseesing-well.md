Every modern motivational technique, strategy, and hack boils down to implementing William Zinsser's advice from [_On Writing Well_](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-William-Zinsser/dp/1559943491).

> _Decide what you want to do. Then decide to do it. Then do it._

OpenSees is no different.

Decide what you want to OpenSees. Then decide to OpenSees it. Then OpenSees it.
