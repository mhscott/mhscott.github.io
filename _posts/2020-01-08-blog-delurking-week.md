title: Blog Delurking Week
category: Random Bits

I found out that this week, the first full week of January, is International Blog Delurking Week. 
Go ahead, Google it. This is a week where followers of a blog are asked to say “Hello” and comment 
on what they hope to see from the blog in the new year.

Besides a GUI that does everything, what do you hope to see from OpenSees in 2020? More Python, 
more documentation, more verification? Do you have ideas for blog posts? Do we need an 
OpenSees Delurking Week where we select obscure models and see if they can pass a patch test?

Let me know your thoughts in the Comments section, or just say “Hi”. Thank you for following the blog.
