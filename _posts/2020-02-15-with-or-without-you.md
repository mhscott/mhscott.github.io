Citation-based metrics are like lottery tickets--they are not for investment
purposes and should be used for entertainment only. Unfortunately, some
promotion and tenure evaluators treat citation-based metrics like investment
decisions.

To aid in evaluation, citation-based metrics are readily available online,
ranging from Web of Science, which indexes only archival publications, to
Google Scholar, which indexes pretty much anything posted on the internet. I
prefer Google Scholar because it counts the numerous citations that are _not_ to
the [OpenSees marker paper]({% post_url 2019-09-22-how-to-cite-opensees %}).
We prefer and advocate for what makes us look good, right?

The hodge podge of non-archival citations is primarily to the OpenSees website
and the user manual. But what happens when I remove this mixed bag of
citations from my Google Scholar profile? As shown below, it's a big difference.

As of 2019, my total citations reduce by a factor of about three and my
h-index drops from 25 to 17 when the non-archival OpenSees citations are
removed. Although the difference in the number of citations has grown
exponentially since 2008, the difference in h-index has held steady between
6 and 8.

So, is ~4000 citations and 8 h-index points all OpenSees is worth? Probably
not, but it's entertaining to examine. Just don't use this information to make
any investment decisions.
