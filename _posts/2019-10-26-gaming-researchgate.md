I think ResearchGate is a good resource. It's in the mix with LinkedIn and Twitter on the spectrum of social networks for academics to 
disseminate their research.

As an external reviewer for promotion and tenure cases, I have seen achievements from ResearchGate included in candidate dossiers. I find 
this dubious because it's quite easy to game the ResearchGate system.

To test this theory, I created a [project](https://www.researchgate.net/project/OpenSees-Blog) on ResearchGate with links to blog posts
as project updates. This was basically 
advertising for the blog, like those [South of the Border](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_of_the_Border_(attraction)) billboards on 
I-95 south leading in to South Carolina. Blog traffic definitely 
increased--ResearchGate must be full of North Carolinians looking to buy fireworks.

After five days of project updates, about one a day announcing blog posts I had already written, this achievement showed up in my 
ResearchGate notifications.

Clearly, I am outperforming my department colleagues. Merit-based increase, here I come! Seriously though, I have colleagues who do some
pretty amazing work that is far more impactful than this blog.

But, be weary of dossiers touting ResearchGate achievements as significant. Same goes for "Most Downloaded Article" achievements. Click, 
graduate students, click!

To be clear, this post is not a criticism of ResearchGate or its users, but rather of those who over emphasize its metrics.
